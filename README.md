Import the weather conditions and forecast from Open Weather Map.

**New:**
- configure the number of days you want to import and show
- fix windspeed units for metric
- convert to Roam Research extensionAPI to allow Hotkeys via Settings
- minor css tweaks

This is an update of David Eaton's original Weather Forecast SmartBlock, with an archived version of the instructions available at https://github.com/dvargas92495/SmartBlocks/issues/211. Please note that as this was David's work I am not receiving any payment from Roam Research for maintaining it for the community.

Set your location, API key and preferred units in the Roam Depot settings. 

You can trigger via the Command Palette or use in a SmartBlock using the command <%WEATHERCARDS%>. Or, set a hotkey in Roam Research Settings > Hotkeys.

This extension also includes a css file that allows the cards to display in a grid:

You will need an API Key from https://openweathermap.org/api. Make sure to subscribe to the Current Weather Data API.
