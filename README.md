This is an update of David Eaton's original Weather Forecast SmartBlock, with an archived version of the instructions available at https://github.com/dvargas92495/SmartBlocks/issues/211.

Set your location, API key and preferred units in the Roam Depot settings. 

You can trigger via the Command Palette or use in a SmartBlock using the command <%WEATHERCARDS%>. Or, set a hotkey in Roam Research Settings > Hotkeys.

This extension also includes a css file that allows the cards to display in a grid:
